TLDR: TenX Community Japan has rebranded into DeFiGeek Community(DFGC) Japan. The DFGC Japan will be powered by the TXJP token, and no token migration will be required as the token address remains [0x961dd84059505d59f82ce4fb87d3c09bec65301d](https://etherscan.io/token/0x961dd84059505d59f82ce4fb87d3c09bec65301d).

### Community Rebranding

January 2021 - We are thrilled to unveil the new name of our community: DeFiGeek Community Japan (DFGC). This change marks an important milestone in our journey as we embark on a path towards shaping the future of decentralized finance (DeFi).

Formerly known as TenX Community Japan, we have undergone a seamless rebranding process to align ourselves with our renewed vision and commitment to DeFi innovation. While DeFiGeek Community (DFGC) may have a fresh name, our foundation and expertise can be traced back to our inception in 2017, where we first came together as a community of passionate supporters of the TenX project.

Over the past four years, we have witnessed the remarkable growth of the crypto market, and this growth has propelled us to redefine our purpose and embrace the transformative power of DeFi. As DeFiGeek Community Japan (DFGC), we are dedicated to becoming a prominent force in the development of DeFi Dapps and tools that contribute to the advancement of Web3.

We believe that collaboration and inclusivity are vital for driving progress in the DeFi space. While developers remain an integral part of our community, we extend a warm welcome to all individuals interested in DeFi. Together, we will create an open platform where every DeFier can freely share their thoughts, learn from one another, and collectively push the boundaries of DeFi innovation.

As we enter this new chapter, our ultimate goal is to evolve into a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). With a flat and sustainable organizational structure, we empower each member of DeFiGeek Community Japan (DFGC) to contribute, lead, and shape the future of our community without the limitations of centralized authority.

We are thrilled to invite you to join us on this exciting journey as we develop DeFi Dapps and tools that will revolutionize the landscape of decentralized finance. Together, we will unlock the true potential of DeFi and shape the future of finance.

### Token rebranding

Whilst the token name reflects the change (to be called DefiGeek Community Japan), the token ticker will remain TXJP. There is no token migration planned and for the avoidance of doubt, the token address will remain [0x961dd84059505d59f82ce4fb87d3c09bec65301d](https://etherscan.io/token/0x961dd84059505d59f82ce4fb87d3c09bec65301d)
