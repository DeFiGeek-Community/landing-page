# Announcement

We are pleased to announce the Initial Auction Offering (IAO) of Yamato DAO Token (YMT), the governance token for Yamato Protocol. The auction will be held on the following dates:

ðŸ—“ July 25, 2025 (Fri), 8:00 AM â€“ August 23, 2025 (Sat), 8:00 PM (JST)


# Overview

## What is Yamato Protocol?
Yamato Protocol is a permissionless stablecoin CDP that allows anyone to freely issue and borrow CJPY, a Japanese yen-pegged stablecoin, by collateralizing ETH.

ðŸ‘‰ What is a stablecoin?

A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency designed to maintain price stability by pegging its value to fiat currencies (like USD), commodities (like gold or oil), or other crypto assets. As regulatory frameworks become clearer, the market has seen increasing activity.
Since its launch in July 2023, Yamato Protocol has operated reliably without incident, and as of July 6, 2025, the total CJPY issued has reached 132m ðŸŽ‰.

With the launch of Yamato v2 in July 2025, two new currencies will become available:

CUSD (pegged to the U.S. dollar)
CEUR (pegged to the Euro)

Official site:
ðŸ‘‰ https://app.yamato.fi/#/

## Peg Mechanism
Soft Peg: 1 CJPY = 1 JPY
CJPY is soft-pegged to the yen using game theory-based mechanisms.

Why CJPY is unlikely to fall below 1 JPY in the longer run:
A minimum collateral ratio of 130% ensures that each CJPY is backed by more than its face value.

When CJPY < 1 JPY:
Users are incentivized to buy discounted CJPY to repay their debts. Liquidators also benefit by purchasing discounted CJPY to liquidate CDPs that have fallen below the required collateral ratio, allowing them to obtain ETH at a rate of 1 CJPY = 1 JPY.

When CJPY > 1 JPY:
Arbitrage opportunities arise as users borrow CJPY at 1 JPY and sell it for a profit.

## YMT Token
Yamato DAO Token (ticker: YMT) is a token primarily earned by borrowing CJPY through the Yamato Protocol.
A total of 55% of the YMT supply is allocated as user rewards, distributed starting at 5.5% in the first year, with a 10% annual reduction thereafter.

Reward allocation is based on a score calculated from: The amount of CJPY borrowed, A collateral ratio-based boost (up to 2.5x), A veYMT-based boost (up to 2.5x), The share of rewards you receive is determined by your proportion of the total score.

ðŸ‘‰ For details on the reward mechanism:

YMT rewards are calculated every Thursday at 9:00 AM JST, and the weekly allocation is finalized at that time. Rewards can be claimed immediately.

## Disclaimer
This IAO is a charity-style public auction that distributes 10 million YMT through a shared bidding process. The acquisition price of YMT is not fixed and will depend entirely on the final bidding results.

Participation in the IAO (i.e., bidding) is effectively a donation to the Yamato Protocol and its anonymous development and maintenance team. No direct or guaranteed return is promised.

In the event of unexpected issuesâ€”such as bugs, system malfunctions, or hacks, all associated funds and tokens may be lost.

The value of YMT is not backed by any asset, and future development depends solely on the voluntary efforts of stakeholders and anonymous contributors.

Yamato Protocol is open-source software (OSS). Anyone can participate in its development and maintenance. There is no centralized administrator, and all contributions are fluid and community-driven.

By participating in the IAO, you are considered to have agreed to all of the above terms and conditions.
