# Overview

Yamawake is a permissionless fair auction token launchpad.

Fair auctions are auctions where all bidders share the tokens up for auction according to their bids, so everyone gets the same price. A minimum total raise amount can be set by the seller to secure the outcome and protect against auction failures.

In V1, an auction can be held where bidders bid in ETH for the sale of ERC20 tokens.
