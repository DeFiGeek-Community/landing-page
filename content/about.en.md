    title: About us
    content: >-
      DeFiGeek Community (DFGC), launched in February 2021, is a decentralized community that develops DeFi Dapps and tools that contribute to Web3.
      DFGC is not a community only for developers. We welcome anyone who is interested in DeFi, and want to create an open community for every DeFier to share their thoughts and learn from each other.

      Our first Dapp is ‘ Yamato Protocol ’. It is a crypto-backed stablecoin which is pegged to Japanese Yen. 
      Our second Dapp is ‘ Yorozu ’ . It is a P2Pool Lending Dapp. 
      Besides the Dapps mentioned above, We also plan to develop a NFT platform and web3 tools to extend the token utility.

      Please note that we are not a community for short-term trading and speculation.

      ### Background of DFGC

      DFGC is a brand new community, but its predecessor can be traced back to 2017. 
      At the time of its launch, it was a community for supporters of new crypto projects to gather, communicate and share thoughts of the crypto market. More than 4 Years have passed since then, and the crypto market has grown significantly. So we rebranded ourselves and decided to transform ourselves into a development community which focuses on DeFi.
      As a result, We have 1049 members and experienced experts, as of October 25, 2021.

      DFGC aims to be a DAO. To become a flat and sustainable organization, we are making efforts to increase the fluidity within the allocation of roles to avoid authority. We welcome all members to demonstrate initiative and leadership.
      In order to achieve our goals, we are not only working on Dapp development, but also on establishing a code of conduct and guidelines to clarify discipline, values and objectives. We aim to be the most active and valuable community in Japanese-speaking communities, which focuses on the development of Web3 middleware and tools.

      ### Development Project

      DFGC is not only commit to a single project or solution like many other communities. With our experienced members, we are always exploring and developing multi-projects, which will be necessary to realize web3.

      - Yamato Protocol
        - crypto-backed stablecoin which is pegged to Japanese Yen
        - DFGC first Dapp in development for testnet launch
      - Yorozu
        - P2Pool Lending Dapp

      In addition to developing products, we are also working on the rules and governance flow that are necessary to grow a community.
